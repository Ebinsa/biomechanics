Cancer Dataset Analysis and Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing a cancer dataset and building a predictive model to identify the type of cancer based on relevant features. The dataset includes various attributes related to cancer patients, and the goal is to leverage machine learning techniques for accurate cancer type predictions.


Dataset
The cancer dataset is provided in the data/ directory. It includes features such as patient age, tumor size, tumor type, and other relevant information. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore and analyze the dataset using statistical and visual techniques. The eda.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains code and visualizations to better understand the data distribution, relationships between features, and potential patterns.

Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing.py script handles data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Training and Evaluation
Logistic Regression Model
Train a logistic regression model using the logistic_regression.py script. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

DECISION TREE
Train a decision tree classifier using the tree_classifier.py script. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

Results and Evaluation
View the results and evaluation metrics in the respective output files or Jupyter notebooks. Compare the performance of different models and choose the one that best fits the dataset characteristics.

Deployment
Once a satisfactory model is trained, deploy it in your preferred environment for real-world predictions. This could involve setting up a web application, API, or integrating the model into an existing healthcare system.
